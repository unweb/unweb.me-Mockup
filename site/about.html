					<h4 class="column-title">Chris Psaltis</h3>
					<p>
						Christos, a.k.a. cpsaltis, was born in 1981 with an urge to find out how  things work. This urge drove him to take apart anything he could get a  hold on, including his first PC. <br id="sykm" /><br id="b4a5" />In 1999 he  moved to Athens to study Survey Engineering in the Technical University.  There he was infected by the virus of academic research. This led him  in 2006 to become a PhD student of photogrammetry and computer vision.  During this period he also discovered Python. <br id="lkdp" /><br id="wwp0" />In  2009 he has already worked as surveyor engineer, researcher and  developer when he decided he was ready for something special. It took  only a meeting in a quiet cafe in Athens for unweb.me to be formed.  Since then he is happily managing projects and herding cats.

				<div id="col-6" class="column half-width last">
					<h4 class="column-title">Dimitris Moraitis</h3>
					<p>
						Dimitris, a.k.a. dimo, was born in 1981. He started coding 7 years later  because there weren't any good enough computer games for his Sinclair  Spectrum ZX+, a serious problem someone had to solve. He kept building  on those skills to solve problems of increasing importance. <br id="ovr4" /><br id="qgji" />In  1998 he moved to Athens to study computer science at the UoA. By 2000  he was developing massive web apps in C for an ISP. He spent a few years  writing PHP untill 2004 when he bumped into Python and discovered how  complex problems can be efficiently tamed in elegant ways.<br id="gv:8" /><br id="ckro" />By  2009 he had worked as a software developer, engineer and project  manager for several IT companies and non-profits worldwide, so it was  time for something completely different. <br id="vaxk" />He co-founded Unweb.me Ltd and has been happilly solving problems since.				</p>

There he discovered the wonder world of free software and  started contributing code and documentation in various projects. <br id="euv9" /><br id="h-ko" />Upon  finishing his studies, he left for Ireland to work for SAP on network  security. By 2007 he had decided he can't stand the cloudy weather and  came back to Greece where he worked as a researcher in the Athens  University of Economics and Business. There he created the Indywiki  project, in his search for alternative and more intuitive ways of  navigating wikipedia. <br id="c0m4" /><br id="t9wq" />In 2009, he decided to  pursue his dream of professionally producing free software and joined  forces with the rest of the unweb.me crew.

					<p>

In fact, some say he is still completely  unaware of their existence.&#160;<br id="nhfg" /><br id="til7" />For  the past 12 years he has been working as a freelance web developer. He  has also worked 5 years in the Technical University of Athens developing  e-learning software. <br id="e2wh" /><br id="e_cm" />For the past years he  has been coding in Python and Plone, usually alongside Dimitris, and  together with Markos and Christos they started unweb.me in an attempt to  take over the world.
